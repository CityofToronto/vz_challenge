# Neighbourhoods

## Description
The City of Toronto's Social Development, Finance & Administration Division maintains a dataset of the boundaries of all the neighbourhoods in the City of Toronto. More information on the neighbourhoods in Toronto can be found on the [City website](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/neighbourhoods-communities/neighbourhood-profiles/).

The data is current as of 2014, and is in the MTM 3 Degree Zone 10 NAD27, WGS84 Latitude/Longitude, and UTM 6 Degree Zone 17N NAD27 projections. 

**Format:** ESRI Shapefile

The data is available through the [City of Toronto's Open Data Catalogue](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#a45bd45a-ede8-730e-1abc-93105b2c439f).

## Relevance to Vision Zero Challenge
Many of the datasets provided as part of this challenge are linked to specific neighbourhoods, such as those under the [Wellbeing Toronto application](http://map.toronto.ca/wellbeing/). These datasets can be downloaded and used in conjunction with this neighbourhood boundaries file.
