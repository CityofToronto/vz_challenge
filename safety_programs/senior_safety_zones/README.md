## Senior Safety Zones 

### Description 
This dataset contains the locations of all of the Senior Safety Zones in the City of Toronto. The data is owned by the City of Toronto's Transportation Services Division, and is available in the form of a shapefile with the MTM 3 Degree Zone 10 NAD27 projection, and is uploaded in this GitHub directory in the data folder.

### Relevance to the Vision Zero Challenge
This dataset is relevant to the the Vision Zero Challenge because the safety zones identify and focus on areas with higher populations of seniors, who are at risk of vehicle-pedestrian incidents.
