# School Flex-Post Road Signs

## Description
The City of Toronto Transportation Services maintains [this dataset](school_flex_post_signs.zip), `school_flex_post_signs.zip`, which contains the locations of the flex-post school safety zone signs that were installed in 2017. These signs are part of a pilot project of the City of Toronto's Vision Zero Road Safety Plan. The signs are flexible, do not cause damage when hit, return back to the upright position after being hit, and are installed in the middle of the roadway between lanes. The signs are a traffic calming measure designed to reduce excessive speeding and dangerous driving.
