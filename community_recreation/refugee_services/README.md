# Refugee Services

## Description
This dataset contains a list of all the centres that provide services to refugees and immigrants, and includes a wide range of services and communities listed. The dataset is sourced from 211 Toronto in comma seperated values (CSV) format, and was last updated in April 2018.

## Relevance to the Vision Zero Challenge
These centres provide services to newcomers of the community, which may have linkages to populations that are at higher risk of being involved in a serious collision. These centres are also hubs for newcomers to interact with the community, possibly indicative of areas of higher traffic.
