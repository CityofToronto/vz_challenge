The data is current to February 2016, and is provided in MTM 3 Degree Zone 10 NAD27 and WGS84.

## Relevance to Vision Zero Challenge
Cultural points of interest are places where members of the community gather, and are likely to experience heavier pedestrian traffic. Pedestrians are one of the six emphasis areas defined under the City of Toronto's Vision Zero Road Safety Plan, and as such are the focus of a number of existing and planned safety measures.
