## Relevance to Vision Zero Challenge
These points of interest are places where members of the community gather, and are likely to experience heavier pedestrian traffic. Pedestrians are one of the six emphasis areas defined under the City of Toronto's Vision Zero Road Safety Plan, and as such are the focus of a number of existing and planned safety measures.
