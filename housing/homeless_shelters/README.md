## Relevance to the Vision Zero Challenge 
Homeless shelter are used by people who are likely to walk to the centres and are at-risk of collisions with vehicles. Pedestrians are one of the six emphasis areas defined under the City of Toronto's Vision Zero Road Safety Plan, and as such are the focus of a number of existing and planned safety measures.
