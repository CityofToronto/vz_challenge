# Traffic Signals

## Description
The City of Toronto's Transportation Services Division maintains lists of all traffic signals, flashing beacons, and pedestrian crossovers within the City of Toronto, including their locations. These datasets also include related operational characteristics, such as the type of system and the date the signal was activated.

**Format:** Comma Separated Values (CSV); JavaScript Object Notation (JSON); Extensible Markup Language (XML)

The datasets are available on the City of Toronto's [Open Data Portal](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#6899bafa-1ffb-faaa-3bb2-7d2eac794205).

## Relevance to the Vision Zero Challenge
Signalized intersections and pedestrian crossovers (PXOs) are key components of the City of Toronto's transportation network. These intersections are the base layer on which transportation infrastructure is built, and against which many transportation datasets are referenced.

## Data Dictionary
The City of Toronto maintains data dictionaries of all four datasets, located [here](https://www.toronto.ca/ext/open_data/catalog/data_set_files/Traffic%20Signals%20Tabular_Meta%20Data_v2.xlsx).
