# Sidewalk Inventory

## Description
The City of Toronto's Transportation Services Division maintains the sidewalk inventory, which provides information on the location of sidewalks along all transportation corridors within the City of Toronto limits. This inventory may also be used to identify and prioritize the building of new sidewalk links. The data was last updated in 2015. 

**Format:** ESRI Shapefile

The data is available on the City of Toronto's [Open Data Catalogue](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#3763d352-5f0a-4385-4cec-f255d4860ea5). 

## Relevance to the Vision Zero Challenge 
Sidewalks are the primary transportation facilities utilized by pedestrians. Pedestrians are one of the six emphasis areas defined under the City of Toronto's Vision Zero Road Safety Plan, and as such are the focus of a number of existing and planned safety measures.
