## Relevance to the Vision Zero Challenge 
The services provided by Aboriginal Service Organizations are accessed by members of the community who could be at a higher risk of vehicular incidents. Pedestrians are one of the six emphasis areas defined under the City of Toronto's Vision Zero Road Safety Plan, and is the focus of a number of existing and planned safety measures.
