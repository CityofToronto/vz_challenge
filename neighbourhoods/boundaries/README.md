# Neighbourhoods

## Description 
This dataset documents the boundaries of all the neighbourhoods in the City of Toronto. More information on the neighbourhoods in Toronto can be found on the [City website](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/neighbourhoods-communities/neighbourhood-profiles/).

The data is current as of 2014, and is owned by the City of Toronto's Social Development, Finance & Administration Division. The data is avaliable in the form of ESRI shapefiles in the MTM 3 Degree Zone 10 NAD27, WGS84 Latitude/Longitude, and UTM 6 Degree Zone 17N NAD27 projections. 

## Relevance to Vision Zero Challenge
Many of the datasets provided as part of this challenge are linked to specific neighbourhoods, such as those under the [Wellbeing Toronto application](http://map.toronto.ca/wellbeing/). These datasets can be downloaded and used in conjunction with this neighbourhood boundaries file.
