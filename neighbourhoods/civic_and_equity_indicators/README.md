# Civic and Equity Indicators (Wellbeing Toronto)

## Description
The City of Toronto's Social Development, Finance & Administration Division maintains a dataset of aggregated, neighbourhood-level metrics detailing specific measures of civic engagement, diversity, and equity.

The data was uploaded in December 2014 (data from 2011 and 2008 is also provided in the dataset). 

**Format:** Excel workbook (xlsx)

The data is availiable through the City of Toronto's [Open Data Catalogue](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#612399e3-f046-ad8f-a8fd-7694b3dd2c81).

## Relevance to the Vision Zero Challenge
This dataset provides neighbourhood-specific metrics that can potentially be linked to areas where collisions occur more frequently, or where persons at higher risk of being involved in a serious collision may reside.
