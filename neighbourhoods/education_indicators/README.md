# Education (Wellbeing Toronto)

## Description 
The City of Toronto's Social Development, Finance & Administration Division maintains a dataset listing several education indicators for the City of Toronto, by neighbourhood. The dataset is sourced from multiple organizations, including the Toronto Public Library, Toronto District School Board, Toronto Catholic District School Board, and Mothercraft. 

Users should note that the data for each neighbourhood are based on the mathematical aggregation of smaller sub-areas (in this case Census Tracts) that, when combined, define the entire neighbourhood. Since smaller areas may have their values rounded or suppressed (to abide by Statistics Canada privacy standards), the overall total may be undercounted. The data was last updated on December 2014 (data from 2008 and 2011 is provided). 

**Format:** Excel workbook (xlsx)

The data is available through the City of Toronto's [Open Data Catalogue](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#dae097ba-5a76-b817-e724-362611c10317).

## Relevance to the Vision Zero Challenge 
Education indicators can be used to provide insights into the school-age populations in neighbourhoods across the City of Toronto. School Children are one of the six emphasis areas as defined in the City of Toronto's Vision Zero Road Safety Plan, and are the focus of a number of existing and planned safety measures.
