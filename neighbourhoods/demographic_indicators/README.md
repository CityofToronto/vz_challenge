# Demographics (Wellbeing Toronto)

## Description
The City of Toronto's Social Development, Finance & Administration Division maintains this dataset.

**Demographics (2006 and 2011 Census Data)**
This dataset contains three worksheets. The full description for each column of data is available in the first worksheet called "IndicatorMetaData". The data came from the 2006 and 2011 Census. Some of the data from the 2011 Census was not available at the time of publishing. Refer to the descriptions in worksheet 1 for more information. Information on how the populations were derived are also found in worksheet 1.

Users should note that the data for each neighbourhood are based on the mathematical aggregation of smaller sub-areas (in this case Census Tracts) that when combined, define the entire neighbourhood. Since smaller areas may have their values rounded or suppressed (to abide by Statistics Canada privacy standards), the overall total may be undercounted.

**Population Total  (2016 Census Data)**
The data refers to Total Population from the 2016 Census, aggregated by the City of Toronto to the City’s 140 Neighbourhood Planning Areas. Although Statistics Canada makes a great effort to count every person, in each Census a notable number of people are left out for a variety of reasons. For example, people may be travelling, some dwellings are hard to find, and some people simply refuse to participate.  Statistics Canada takes this into account and for each Census estimates a net ‘undercoverage’ rate for the urban region, the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area (CMA), but not for the city. The 2011 rate for the Toronto CMA was 3.72% ± 0.53%. The 2016 rate is not yet available. 

The data is current as of February 2017. 

**Format:** Excel workbook (xlsx)

The data is availiable through the City of Toronto's [Open Data Catalogue](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#1dff195c-84f0-02d1-a9d3-cc6c44b38a31).

## Relevance to Vision Zero Challenge 
This dataset provides demographics information about the number of people of varying age groups that live in each neighbourhood in the City of Toronto. In particular, this may help identify neighbourhoods with high populations of School Children and/or Older Adults, twoof the six emphasis areas defined under the City of Toronto's Vision Zero Road Safety Plan.
