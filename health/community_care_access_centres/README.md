# Community Care Access Centres (CCACs)

## Description 
Locations of Head offices of Community Care Access Centres (CCACs) in Ontario, including geographical information for the head offices of Community Care Access Centres (CCACs). The CCACs are the local organizations established by the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care to provide people with access to government-funded home and community services, and long-term care homes. They also provide information about, and connect people to, local community support service agencies to arrange services.

The data is current to 2017 and is updated by the Ministry of Health and Long Term Care as needed. The data is in the form of a shapefile and is owned by the Government of Ontario. It is available on the Government of Ontario's [Open Data Catalogue](https://www.ontario.ca/data/community-care-access-centre-ccacs-locations).

## Relevance to the Vision Zero Challenge 
CCACs are likely used by populations at higher risk of being involved in a serious collision. This dataset provides locations at which these populations may be located or are likely to visit.
