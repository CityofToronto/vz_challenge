# Community Care Access Centres (CCACs)

## Description
The Ministry of Health and Long Term Care updates data on the geographical information of the head offices of Community Care Access Centres (CCACs) in Ontario. The CCACs are local organizations established by the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care to provide people with access to government-funded home and community services and long-term care homes. They also provide information about and connect people to local community support service agencies to arrange services.

The data is current to 2017 and is owned by the Government of Ontario.

## Relevance to the Vision Zero Challenge 
CCACs are a hub of services and communication for care and other community agencies, and communities with CCACs see higher concentrations of senior pedestrians living and interacting. Older adults are one of the six emphasis areas defined under the City of Toronto's Vision Zero Road Safety Plan, and is the focus of a number of existing and planned safety measures.
