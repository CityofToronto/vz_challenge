# Family Health Teams (FHT) Locations

## Description 
Family Health Teams (FHT) are community-centred primary care organizations created to provide comprehensive family health care services across Ontario. FHTs provide primary care services to rural, urban, and unique populations of patients with both typical and specialized health needs.

This dataset includes the FHT’s main office locations as well as the practice locations of the family physicians affiliated with the FHT. A physician can practice at more than one location, however, only their primary address is included in this dataset.

Note: It is possible that a FHT’s main office has no practicing physicians at that location.

The dataset is updated by the Ministry of Health and Long Term Care as needed, and is current up until 2017. The data is in the form of a shapefile and is owned by the Government of Ontario. It availiable on the Government of Ontario's [Open Data Catalogue](https://www.ontario.ca/data/family-health-team-fht-locations).

## Relevance to the Vision Zero Challenge 
FHTs are likely used by populations at higher risk of being involved in a serious collision. This dataset provides locations at which these populations may be located or are likely to visit.
