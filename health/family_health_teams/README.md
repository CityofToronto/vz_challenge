# Family Health Teams (FHT) Locations

## Description
The Ministry of Health and Long Term Care updates the dataset on Family Health Teams (FHTs), which are community-centred primary care organizations created to provide comprehensive family health care services across Ontario. FHTs provide primary care services to rural, urban, and unique populations of patients with both typical and specialized health needs.

This dataset includes the FHT’s main office locations as well as the practice locations of the family physicians affiliated with the FHT. A physician can practice at more than one location, however, only their primary address is included in this dataset.

Note: It is possible that a FHT’s main office has no practicing physicians at that location.

The dataset is current up until 2017 and is owned by the Government of Ontario. 

**Format:** ESRI Shapefile

The dataset is available on the Government of Ontario's [Open Data Catalogue](https://www.ontario.ca/data/family-health-team-fht-locations).

## Relevance to the Vision Zero Challenge 
FHTs are used by families to access health care professionals and comprehensive family health care services within their community. The locations of FHTs are likely to be frequented by adults and their children. School children are one of the six emphasis areas defined under the City of Toronto's Vision Zero Road Safety Plan, and are the focus of a number of existing and planned safety measures.
