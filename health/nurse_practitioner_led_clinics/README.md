## Description
The Ministry of Health and Long Term Care updates the dataset on the geographic information on the locations of Nurse Practitioner Led Clinics (NPLC). These are primary health care organizations that provide comprehensive, accessible, person centred, and co-ordinated services for people of all ages and stages of life in over 20 communities across Ontario.

The data is current as of January 2017 and is owned by the Government of Ontario. 

**Format:** ESRI Shapefile

The dataset is available on the Government of Ontario's [Open Data Catalogue](https://www.ontario.ca/data/mental-health-and-addiction-organization-mhao-locations).

## Relevance to the Vision Zero Challenge 
NPLCs are clinics that are likely to be used by persons that are at increased risk of being involved in a serious collision, mainly persons with disabilities and seniors. Older Adults are one of the six emphasis areas defined under the City of Toronto's Vision Zero Road Safety Plan, and are the focus of a number of existing and planned safety measures.
