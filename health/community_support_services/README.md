#  Community Support Services (CSS)

## Description 
The Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care maintains a geospatial dataset containing the locations of community support services (CSS) in Ontario. These services help people to maintain their safety and independence while living at home, and are delivered either at home or locations around the community. There are a variety of possible community support services that may be provided by a specific facility (e.g. social and recreational services, transportation, etc.). This dataset was last updated on January 2017.

**Format:** ESRI Shapefile (WGS84)

The dataset is available on the Government of Ontario's [Open Data Catalogue](https://www.ontario.ca/data/community-support-service-css-locations).

## Relevance to the Vision Zero Challenge 
Community support services are likely used by persons that are at increased risk of being involved in a serious collision, mainly persons with disabilities and seniors. Older Adults are one of the six emphasis areas defined under the City of Toronto's Vision Zero Road Safety Plan, and are the focus of a number of existing and planned safety measures.
