## Relevance to the Vision Zero Challenge 
Walk-In Clinics are often visited by older adults and other persons with medical needs. These populations are often at higher risk of serious collisions with motorized vehicles. This dataset provides locations at which these populations may be located or are likely to visit. Pedestrians and older adults are two of the six emphasis areas defined under the City of Toronto's Vision Zero Road Safety Plan, and as such are the focus of a number of existing and planned safety measures.
