# Hospitals

## Description 
The Ministry of Health and Long Term Care updates this dataset of geographical information of hospitals, including public, private, and specialty psychiatric hospitals. 

The data is current to January 2017 and is owned by the Government of Ontario. 

**Format:** ESRI Shapefile

The dataset is available on the Government of Ontario's [Open Data Catalogue](https://www.ontario.ca/data/hospital-locations).

## Relevance to the Vision Zero Challenge 
Hospitals are likely to be used by persons that are at increased risk of being involved in a serious collision, mainly persons with disabilities, seniors, and families with children. Older Adults and school children are two of the six emphasis areas defined under the City of Toronto's Vision Zero Road Safety Plan, and are the focus of a number of existing and planned safety measures.
