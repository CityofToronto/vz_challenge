# Mental Health and Addiction Organization (MHAO) locations

## Description
The Ministry of Health and Long Term Care updates the dataset on the locations of mental health and addiction organizations in Ontario, including locations associated with the Mental Health and Addiction Organization. This dataset uses information in the ConnexOntario database to produce directories of addiction and mental health services in the province. ConnexOntario operates three helplines (Drug and Alcohol Helpline, Ontario Problem Gambling Helpline, and Mental Health Helpline) and provides free and confidential health services information for people experiencing problems with gambling, drugs or alcohol and mental health.

The data is current as of January 2017 and is owned by the Government of Ontario. 

**Format:** ESRI Shapefile

The dataset is available on the Government of Ontario's [Open Data Catalogue](https://www.ontario.ca/data/mental-health-and-addiction-organization-mhao-locations).

## Relevance to the Vision Zero Challenge 
MHAO services are used by members of the community to access addiction and mental health care programs, and may see higher volumes of pedestrian traffic. Pedestrians are one of the six emphasis areas defined under the City of Toronto's Vision Zero Road Safety Plan, and is the focus of a number of existing and planned safety measures.
