# Parks (City Green Space) 

## Description
The City of Toronto's Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division owns this dataset, which includes the boundaries and park names for over 2000 public green areas within the City of Toronto. Each park is described with a unique identifier, name, and feature code. The dataset is current to April 2018. The data is available in two spatial formats: the MTM 3 Degree Zone 10 NAD27 projection, or WGS84 (unprojected). 

**Format:** ESRI Shapefile

This dataset can be found in the City of Toronto's [Open Data Catalogue](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#d203b048-26d0-2e3b-da9f-16a5af5c07f8).

## Relevance to the Vision Zero Challenge
Parks are open spaces that are used by many members of the community including school children, older adults, and cyclists. In addition, there may be an increased number of pedestrians on city streets in close proximity to parks. Pedestrians, School Children, Older Adults, and Cyclists are four of the six emphasis areas defined under the City of Toronto's Vision Zero Road Safety Plan, and as such are the focus of a number of existing and planned safety measures.
