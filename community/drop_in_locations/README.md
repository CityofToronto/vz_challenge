# Drop-In Locations (Toronto Drop-In Network Members - TDIN)

## Description
The City of Toronto's Shelter Support & Housing Administration Division maintains a dataset of drop-in centres within the City of Toronto that are members of the Toronto Drop-In Network (TDIN). TDIN is an active coalition of drop-in centres working with people who are homeless, marginally housed or socially isolated in Toronto. Their network includes drop-ins of all sizes and diverse philosophies serving men, women, youth, seniors and families. Drop-ins provide a range of services that can include health care, recreational programs and housing support. This dataset can be linked to the City's Street Centreline.

**Format:** ESRI Shapefile (MTM 3 Zone 10 NAD27; WGS84)

The data is available on the City of Toronto's [Open Data Catalogue](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#0365988c-3ead-45f4-d25d-6dbdeb7a8720).

## Relevance to the Vision Zero Challenge 
TDIN drop-in centres may be linked to populations at higher risk of being involved in a serious collision, and are generally centres of high pedestrian activity. Pedestrians are one of the six emphasis areas defined under the City of Toronto's Vision Zero Road Safety Plan, and is the focus of a number of existing and planned safety measures.
