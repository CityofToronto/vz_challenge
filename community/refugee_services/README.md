# Refugee Services

## Description
211 Toronto owns [this dataset](refugee_services_211.csv) `refugee_services_211.csv`, which contains a list of all the centres that provide services to refugees and immigrants, and includes a wide range of services and communities listed. The dataset was last updated in April 2018.

**Format:** Comma Separated Values (CSV)

## Relevance to the Vision Zero Challenge
These centres provide services to newcomers, which may have linkages to populations that are at higher risk of being involved in a serious collision.
